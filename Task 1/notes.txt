Hi Hanlin,*
*) If the user provides 1 text file, your program should return the corresponding profile
*) If the user provides 2 text file, your program should compute the two profiles, normalise each, compare the normalised profiles, after which the profiles are no longer required as they are not the point here.

Fair enough?
